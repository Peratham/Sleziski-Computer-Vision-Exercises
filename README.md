Szeliski-Computer-Vision-Exercises
===================================

 (My apologies to Sleziski for the mispelling in the repo. I will change if I figure out how.)

A collection of programs written to fulfill the exercises for Richard Slezinski's book, Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications

I'm experimenting with Julia, and maybe add some source files in Julia, but for now I'm writing it in Javascript so as to be more easily shareable with people online.

A series of blog posts related to my learning endeavors is hopefully to come as well!

Untl I host it somewhere, just clone the project and open index.html.
